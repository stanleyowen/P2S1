        Our school has been celebrating P2S1 (<Link href="/">see more</Link>)
        for long time but due to the pandemic in the last 2 years, we were not
        able to hold the P2S1 event offline. However, we could celebrate the
        26th P2S1 this year! It commenced on the first week of January 2023, and
        ended on the first week of March. A total of 48 types of competitions
        were held in this event involving a large number of students, 1,609
        participants to be exact. Not to mention the fact that as many as 3,197
        participants were registered.

        We were able to hold such a great event this year thanks to the students
        who had participated. Congratulations to all of the champions. Keep up
        the great work! For those who havenâ€˜t achieved the top 3, do not feel
        discouraged because there is always room to grow. See you on the 27th
        P2S1 next year.
