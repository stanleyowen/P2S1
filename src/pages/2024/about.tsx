        The 27<sup>th</sup> Pekan Prestasi Sutomo 1
      </h1>
      <p className="text-justify">
        SMA Sutomo 1 has had the great honor of celebrating the 27
        <sup>th</sup> P2S1 this year. The P2S1 event has been held throughout
        the years with different themes and this year we were proud to present
        the theme of Amelioration, meaning "to improve or make something
        better". The event kicked off on the first week of January 2024 and
        ended on the last week of February 2024. 51 competitions were held this
        year, ranging from academics, arts, sports, and content creation. The 27
        <sup>th</sup> P2S1 was grateful to have been supported by the presence
        of the 1292 participants. To conclude, we send special thanks to all
        participants of the 27<sup>th</sup> P2S1 for making this event a
        success. Lastly, congratulations to all the winners of this year's P2S1
        and commiserations to those who have not entered the top 3. Do not feel
        discouraged, there are many fish in the sea and your future does not end
        here. Work hard and never give up!
